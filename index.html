					<h2> A little about myself... </h2>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">
						My biggest passion is exploring things. I am someone who is curious about how things work,
						ranging from a nailcutter to complex robots. I tend to prefer logic
						over assumption, beacuse in the end things should make sense!
						<br><br>
						I have always been inclined towards Maths and find it compelling since there is a reason behind
						everything (unlike Chemistry xD). It is also one of the reasons that I love programming and solving 
						quizzes and puzzles. I am intrigued by data structures and algorithms and that's why I love doing 
						Competitive Programming. It helps me to solve problems in an aim oriented way and develop logic out
						of things. 	
						<br>
						Other than Competitive Programming, I have special interests in Software Developement, where I 
						love to build and design new websites and host them. I am passionate about how big companies work,
						and it is my dream to get into one of the big techies of the world. Next on my list of interests are 
						academic courses like Operating Systems, Computer Networks and Compilers which I find fasinating and 
						eager to learn.
						<br><br>
						When I am not studying (or exploring random things on a computer) nor playing football (very rare), I can 
						be found writing (I like to write short horror stories), reading a novel (my favourite reads: Dan Brown <i>The Digital Fortess</i>,
						RL Stine's <i>Goosebumps</i> and Agatha Christie's <i>Murder on the Orient Express</i>), or eating pizza. Finally, I try to devote 
						whatsoever time I can get to sitting with my parents and brother and talking and laughing with them. They are the most 
						wonderful people in my life.

					<h2> and then there was football.... </h2>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">
						Whenever I am stressed or need a break, there is only one thing that always works.
						And that is to pick a football and kick it around wherever I am.
						I love football as much I love anything else, I tend to get cranky if I go more than 
						two weeks without playing football.
						<br><br>
						I started watching football in 2012, and it was love at first sight. I have great 
						admiration for the beauty of the sport, and once you fall in love with football, it's 
						not difficult to see why it is the world's most popular sport.
						Football is like dynamic chess, and once the tactics are executed as planned, it is a 
						treat to watch and witness.
						<br><br>
						All you need to play is a ball, and that's why it is highly probable that you will find me 
						with a football at my feet, just passing it around my room or breaking things in my house!
						<br>
						I joined the Patel Hall football team in my second year and we had practise everyday. The 
						Captain knew exactly what the team needed to be able to compete in the upcoming General Championships.
						He made us work hard and made sure that every practise session was fun. In the end, we made the ends meet 
						and won Bronze medal at the General Championships. It was one of the most memorable things to happen to me 
						in kgp.
						<br>
						My favourite club is Real Madrid, and I am a huge admirer of Cristiano Ronaldo. His hard work and 
						rigirous routine has made him what he is today, and in my eyes, he is the GOAT.
						<br><br>
						<!-- When I am not programming or sleeping, I am probably checking out when the next match is, or planning to 
						play football. I am grateful to football for what it is, and I am grateful that football happened to me.
						I think it is fair to say that football is the love of my life. -->
						Apart from getting a good job at a good company, my next biggest dream is to visit Madrid and 
						watch a football match at the Santiago Bernabeu Stadium, home of Real Madrid. I hope to be able 
						to realize my dream one day, until then, Halamadrid!
